# Guild-Education-Work-Sample--R-Studio

Task: The business has requested a breakdown of movie genres by year as documented by IMDB. Write a program that processes the input file and generates an output CSV file with the headers “genre, year, count”.

-In order to complete this task, I downloaded the input data file at:
https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/com.guild.us-west-2.public-data/project-data/movies_metadata_sample.csv.gz

-I completed the task using the R programming language, and I used the R Studio infrastructure to write my code. 

Directions: Open up my code in R Studio and run it as is. The new csv file will be downloaded onto your computer and you should be able to view it. I have attached a copy of what my csv file looked like after the code was run in the repository.
